\section{Maximal Tori}
\begin{definition}
	A \df{maximal torus} $T \subset G$ is a torus that is not contained in any larger torus.
	
	Since $G$ has a finite dimension, it always has at least one maximal torus.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
	If $G = \GL_n(k)$, then $k^\times$ is its maximal torus.
\end{example}
\begin{lemma}
	Let $G$ be a connected algebraic group. Let $s \in G$ be semisimple. Then, there is a maximal torus in $G$ s.t.
	\[ C(s) \cap T \neq \emptyset \]
	where $C(s) = \set{gsg\i}{g\in G}.$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Choose a Borel group $B \subset G$ s.t. $s \in B$. Then, we can decompose
	\[ B \isom{} U \rtimes T. \]
	$T$ is a torus. By the previous theorem, we know that a conjugate of $s$ is contained in $T$. The claim follows, if we enlarge $T$ to a maximal torus in $G$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $G$ be a connected algebraic group with a maximal torus $T$. Let $s \in G$ be semisimple. Then, 
	\[ C(s) \cap T \neq \emptyset. \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	We only show the theorem in case $\mathrm{char} k = 0$.
	
	Since $T$ is connected and solvable, it is contained in some Borel group $B$.
	
	Choose further a Borel group $B' = U \rtimes S$ s.t. $s\in B'$ is conjugate to some element $s' \in S$.
	
	Now, $B'$ is conjugate to $B$. If we choose a generator $t \in T$ s.t.
	\[ \overline{\shrp{t}} = T, \]
	then $t$ is conjugated to some element $t' \in S$. The torus $T' = \overline{\shrp{t'}}$ generated by $t'$ is again maximal, therefore
	\[ T' = S. \]
	Since $s' \in T'$, the claim follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	Let $G$ be a connected algebraic group.
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item Any two maximal tori are conjugate.
		\item For each torus $S$ and each maximal torus $T$ exists a $g \in G$ s.t.
		\[ gSg\i \subset T. \]
	\end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	(i) follows, if we can show (ii).
	
	Let $S$ be torus with a generator $s$. Then there is a $g \in G$ s.t.
	\[ gsg\i \in T. \]
	Ergo
	\[ gSg\i = \overline{\shrp{gsg\i}} \subset T. \]
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	Let $s$ be a central semisimple element of $G$ (i.e. $s$ commutates with each other element). Then $s$ is contained in every maximal torus. In other words
	\[ Z(G)_s \subset \bigcap_{T \text{ max. torus}}T. \]
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
This is clear, since a conjugate of $s$ must be contained in each maximal torus and $s$ commutes with each element.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
	Let $T$ be a torus in a connected group $G$.
	Then, $T$ is maximal iff its dimension is maximal among all dimensions of tori in $G$.
\end{corollary}
