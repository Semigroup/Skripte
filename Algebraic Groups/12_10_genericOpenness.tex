\subsection{Generic Openness}
\begin{proposition}
Let $\phi : X \pfeil{} Y$ be a dominant morphism of quasi-projective varieties.

Then, there is an open nonempty set $U \subset X$, s.t., $\phi_{|U}$ is open, that is, it maps open sets to open sets.
\end{proposition}

\begin{corollary}
	Let $G$ be a connected algebraic group.
	
	Then, $[G,G] = \shrp{aba\i b\i ~|~a,b \in G}$ is a closed subgroup of $G$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	For $a,b \in G$, set
	\[ [a,b] = aba\i b\i. \]
	For $n\geq 0$, define
	\begin{align*}
	\phi_n : G^{2n} &\Pfeil{} G\\
	(a_1,b_1,\ldots, a_n,b_n) & \longmapsto [a_1, b_1] \cdots [a_n, b_n].
	\end{align*}
	Let $Z_n := \overline{\Img \phi_n}$.
	Then, we have an ascending chain
	\[ Z_1 \subseteq Z_2 \subseteq \ldots \]
	Each $Z_n$ is closed and irreducible, because $G^{2n}$ is connected.
	
	Then, at some point the chains of $Z_i$'s must become stationary, because $\dim(G) < \infty$, because $\O(G)$ is a fintely generated $k$-algebra.
	
	Let $N$ be s.t.
	\[ Z_N = Z_{N+1} = \ldots. \]
	
	Since $[G,G] = \bigcup_n \Img(\phi_n)$, we have then
	\[ Z_N = \bigcup_n Z_n = \overline{[G,G]}. \]
	
	Since $\phi_n : G^{2n} \pfeil{} Z_n$ is dominant and since $G^{2n}$ and $Z_n$ are quasi-projective varieties, $\Img \phi_n = [G,G]$ contains a nonempty open subset $U$.
	
	Now, let $h \in \overline{[G,G]}$. Then, $hU\cap U\neq \emptyset$, since both are nonempty open and $\overline{[G,G]}$ is irreducible. Therefore, we have $u_1, u_2 \in U \subseteq [G,G]$ with
	\[ hu_1 = u_2. \]
	Ergo, $h$ lies in $[G,G]$.
