\subsection{Borel's Fixed Point Theorem (special case)}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $G$ be a connected solvable algebraic subgroup of $\GL(V)$, where $V$ is a finite-dimensional non-trivial vector space.
	
	Then, $G$ acts algebraically on $\P(V)$.
	
	Let $X \subseteq\P(V)$ be a non-empty, closed $G$-stable subset. Then, $G$ has a fixed point in $X$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	We prove this by an induction on $n = \dim(V)$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $n = 1$:\\
		In this case, $\P(V)$ contains only one element.
		\item $n = 2$:\\
		We have $\P V \isom{} \P^1$. If $X = \P(V)$, then there is a complete invariant flag $0 \subset \shrp{v} \subset V$ which is $G$-stable.
		
		Then, $[v]$ is fixed by $G$.
		
		If $X$ is finite, let $x \in X$. Then, $G.x$ is a connected subset of $X$, hence $G.x = \{x\}$.
		\item $n \geq 3$:\\
		Take again a complete $G$-stable flag $0 \subset \shrp{v} \subset \ldots \subset V$. If $[v] \in X$, we are done.
		
		Otherwise, consider the morphism
		\[ \phi : X \Pfeil{} \P(V / \shrp{v}). \]
		Since $\shrp{v}$ is $G$-invariant, $G$ acts on $\P(V / \shrp{v})$ and $\phi$ is $G$-equivariant.
		
		The image $\phi(X)$ is closed by a theorem in the preceeding subsection. By the induction hypothesis, there is a fixed point $[w + \shrp{v}] \in \phi(X) \subseteq \P(V / \shrp{v})$.
		
		In particular, $[w+\shrp{v}]$ has a preimage $[w]$ in $X$. Consider the subset
		\[ W := \shrp{w,v} \subseteq V. \]
		$W$ is $G$-stable and we have $\P W \cap X\neq \emptyset$. Since $\P W \cap X$ is closed in $\P W \isom{} \P^2$, it follows from a previous case that there is a $G$-fixed point in $\P W \cap X$.
	\end{itemize}
